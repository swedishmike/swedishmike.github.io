At the end of the day I covered close to 40km. That wasn't really the plan when I set out - but it turned out that way in the end.

The plan was to do around 35 - 37 km, to try and see if I had it in me. That would be the longest 'stage' of one of the two trips I got my mind set on for next year. I guess I did have it in me.

*These are the stats of the walk. Turned into a bit of a loop as you can see.*

*This path is used by quite a lot of bicycle commuters. If you look close up at this low-growing tree you'll see some marks and colour transfer from a number of bicycle helmets. Haven't spotted any skin transfers. Yet.*

*Walking next to the main railway line and then popping out through what looks like a tree tunnel in Steventon.*

*A watering hole for the cows.*

*Not sure if this farming implement is still in/of use...*

*Finding what looks like a ruin is always a big bonus for me. I'll never grow out of feeling excited by stuff like this. I didn't spend much time exploring this, but I feel that I will have to return for some more looking around.*

*An unguarded railway crossing, apparently you should use the provided phone next to it if you are crossing with animals.*

*Walking next to some more fields.*
