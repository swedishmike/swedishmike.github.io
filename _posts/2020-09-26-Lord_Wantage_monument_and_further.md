As the subtitle states, this was a walk of two halves. The first half or so was spent getting to and walking on the Ridgeway.

Given that it was a Saturday with decent autumn weather the Ridgeway was well used by people of all ages and persuuasions. I must admit that I did not expect to meet a 'off-road' recumbent bike, that was a bit of a surprise.

Given that one of my reasons for going on these walks is to get some solitude I must say that I enjoyed the second half more. It might have been on less easy to walk paths, some barely visible, but the feeling of being on my own definitely outweighs that.

For some reason the Lord Wantage Monumnent had turned into some kind of marker for me so when I planned the route I put that as the first waypoint. The next step was just to get some added mileage and that lead to the route bringing me to some places I've not seen before.

The weather was nice for being the end of September but you definitely felt the chill of the wind when you walked over exposed fields and ridges. Northerly winds prevailed, just to make it that extra bit fun. But as they drummed into us in the Scouts back in the day: *"There is no such thing as bad weather, just poor clothing"*. Another layer added and the wind was no longer a problem.
